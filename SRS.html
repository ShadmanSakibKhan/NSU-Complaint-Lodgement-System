			<h3>2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
          <p>List of Constraints:
            <ul>
                <li>The backend should publish APIs which should be easily integrated with the existing University platform like RDS.</li>
                <li>The system needs to be designed with an existing standard web and android framework.</li>
                <li>The system needs to platform independent.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
                
            
			
			<h3>2.6 User Documentation</h3>
            <p>The system is designed to be intuitive and user friendly. But if there are 
                further queries, the user can go through the user manual.
            </p>
            
			<h3>2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
            <p>The system uses external API for accomplishing complicated tasks such as:<br>
                Speech Recognition using Microsoft Speech API (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/rest-speech-to-text#speech-to-text-rest-api-v30) 
                or Google Cloud Vision API (https://centralindia.stt.speech.microsoft.com/speech/recognition/conversation/cognitiveservices/v1).
                </p>
            
                            <!--Section 2 end -->
           
           
           
         <!--Section 3 start-->
           
           
           
    <h1 style="color: darkblue;"id="section-3"><u>3.  External Interface Requirements</u></h1>
		<h3>3.1  User Interfaces</h3>
		<p>
            A login screen will be shown as a user open the software. There the user will able to scan his/her ID card by clicking on a button, another button will allow the user to enter the 
            information manually. After login, user will see the report section. After clicking on the comment section user can create a complaint or any comments. If they want they also can report a comment. 
		</p>

		<h3>3.2  Hardware Interfaces</h3>
		<p>
			The most important hardware for this complaint lodging app requires smartphone and laptop. 
            A clear microphone or headphone should be required for audio interactions. 
            The secondary requirement is an active Internet connection, either by mobile 
            data or Wi-Fi. This is to communicate with the Google Firebase Server and to make API calls.


		</p>


		<h3>3.3  Software Interfaces </h3>
		<p>
			Native development kit will be used to develop the software. For face and eye detection, local 
            facial detection library or a third-party online API will be implemented. To make the app fast 
            and stable, MongoDB database will be used to store the data and sync properly 
            through APIs. A PDF renderer will be implemented that will let the user to open a large file. 

	   </p>

           <h3>3.4  Communications Interfaces </h3>
		<p>
			The software will use APIs to create user account. During the 
            reading session, app will take complains and send it to the server through API. 
            During the complain recording session, app will also send the current page, time to server for statistics.
